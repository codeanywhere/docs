## What is Codeanywhere?

Codeanywhere is a Cross Platform Cloud IDE and it has all the features of Desktop IDE but with additional features only a cloud application can give you! Codeanywhere is very flexible and you can set up your workflow any way you want it. The elegant development environment will let you focus on building great applications quicker. All the features you will need for any coding task are built into Codeanywhere, making development more productive and fun. Codeanywhere can edit many types of files and has all the nice features you are used to in desktop editors:

* More than 120 Programming languages syntax
* Code completion (js, php, html, css)
* Linting (js, css)
* Multiple cursors
* Zen coding support
* Code beautify
* All device and browser support
* Drag and Drop files and folders from your Desktop and edit them
* Open and save files with more than 200.000 lines

Codeanywhere has integrated clients for connecting to FTP, SFTP, FTPS, SSH, Dropbox, Amazon S3, Google Drive, GitHub, Bitbucket and even DigitalOcean, so you can code and deploy without opening up multiple programs! Also, you can create Containers which are your private virtual development environment that you can fully customize through SSH terminal. Each one comes with its own dedicated amount of memory and disk space. You can choose between a large number of predefined stacks (PHP, HTML, Laravel, Wordpress, etc.) or you can create new ones! You can preview your application instantly inside Codeanywhere IDE. Our large file support enables you to open and save files with over 200.000 lines! You can even drag and drop files and folders from your Desktop! Codeanywhere has a sharing capability so you can get help from a colleague, open your code base to a group or simply to show your latest code to your friends and Revisions so you don't have to worry about losing your code ever again!

In short, Codeanywhere will solve all your coding needs on the go, anytime, anywhere and on any platform!


## Quick Tutorial

### Registration and Login

To get started with Codeanywhere, just [Register](https://codeanywhere.com/register) with an account or [Login](https://codeanywhere.com/login) if you are already registered and go to our [Editor](https://codeanywhere.com/editor)!

### Starting up

For this tutorial, we’ll show you how to work with our [Containers](#container), although, you can set up your [SSH](#sftp-ssh)/[FTP](#ftp) server right away, or connect to [Google Drive](#google-drive), [Dropbox](#dropbox), [Amazon S3](#amazon-s3), and even import your existing [repository](#git-from-url) or create your [DigitalOcean Droplet](#digitalocean)! Containers are in essence your own Virtual Private Servers which run invisibly in the background of Codeanywhere, each one with its own amount of RAM, Disk space and Processing power. Containers give you the ability to provision any Development Environment you like. You can even choose between one of the predefined stacks.

In order to start a new [Container](#container), go to File -> New Connections -> Container.

![](http://docs.codeanywhere.com/images/tutorial1.png)

Now, you can choose which predefined stack you’d use. In this tutorial, we’ll create a simple PHP container. Choose which OS you’d like to use - Ubuntu or CentOS - and decide whether you’d like for your Container to be Always on - meaning it will be turned on even when you’re offline.

![](http://docs.codeanywhere.com/images/container-php.png)

Wait for a few seconds until your Container is deployed, and you can start coding right away.

![](http://docs.codeanywhere.com/images/container-created.png)

With a right click on your Container, choose to Create a File, and name it “index.php”.

![](http://docs.codeanywhere.com/images/createfile.png)

You can see in your file tree that your Container is already updated! Go to your file and enter some code - in this example we created a simple “Hello World” app.

![](http://docs.codeanywhere.com/images/indexphp.png)

Save it (just like anywhere else with CMD + S, for Mac, or Ctrl + S, for Windows), and now, all you have to do is select “Run” button with a right click on your app:

![](http://docs.codeanywhere.com/images/run.png)

and you’ll be able to preview your new app!

That’s about it!

You can now [share](#share) your code or work with your colleagues in the same way you’d do that with Google Docs with our [collaboration feature](#pair-programming), and even [share your terminal](#ssh-realtime-collaboration)! If they make some changes you’re not happy with, use our [Revisions feature](#revisions), and get your code back to where you’d like! Sounds interesting? Read our online documentation and learn more about the rest of the cool features we have to offer! :)
