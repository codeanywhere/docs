## Git from URL

Codeanywhere will create a [Container](#container) for each repository and you will be able to edit your code directly from there. Then, you can push changes back to your repo using your SSH Terminal! Just check our [Working with Repositories](#working-with-repositories) section for further instructions.

### Creating an Git Container from URL
Go to File -> New Connection -> GitFromURL

Select a Stack and a name and youâ€™ve created a new [Container](#container) with your repository!
