## PHPMyAdmin

PhpMyAdmin comes preinstalled with our Containers (both CentOS and Ubuntu). To access it first open the info by right-clicking the Container in File Explorer:

![](/images/container-info.png)

At the top of your Info page, you can see your Username and Password. Copy the link into the new tab of your browser and add „/phpmyadmin“ at the end of the link to access phpMyAdmin – it will look something like: [http://preview.xxxxxx.box.codeanywhere.com/phpmyadmin](http://preview.xxxxxx.box.codeanywhere.com/phpmyadmin) or, in this example, [http://port-80.xxxxxx.box.codeanywhere.com/phpmyadmin](http://port-80.xxxxxx.box.codeanywhere.com/phpmyadmin). For login use the "root" as Username, and leave the Password field empty:

Username and password will vary depending on the Stack you choose! You can check it in your Info file in first line.

If you want to be able to access your Container at all times, you can activate our feature Always-on, which will keep your Container running even when you're not using Codeanywhere!
