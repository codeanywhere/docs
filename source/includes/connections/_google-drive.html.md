If the Google Drive account is added successfully it will appear in your File Explorer with the Google Drive icon. Now you can easily edit files from your Google Drive account!

### Invalid Token issue
If you receive an Invalid Token error, it means there is something wrong with your long-term access token, so please try removing and adding your Drive account. If that does not work please try revoking access to Codeanywhere from your Google security page located at: [https://www.google.com/settings/security](https://www.google.com/settings/security) - under Connected apps and sites, Remove Codeanywhere, and afterwards add it again.
