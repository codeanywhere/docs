# Preferences
## Preferences Structure
Youâ€™ll see preferences in Top Menu Bar. Preferences can be defined in one of two Layers: User and Project Preferences. When retrieving a preference value, preferences defined in Project layer are taken first, then if not defined there, values from User Lazer are used and if nothing is defined there as well, Default value is used.

Preferences can be defined using Graphical user interface or by editing JSON file.

Bz default, GUI Preferences is used but if you prefer defining your preferences in JSON, you can turn on "Open as JSON" in Preferences section of Top Menu Bar.

There is 5 Preferences categories:

* [General](#general)
* [Key Bindings](#key-bindings)
* [FileTypes](#filetypes)
* [Linting](#linting)
* [Snippets](#snippets)

## General
General Preferences are divided in three groups: Workspace, File Explorer and Editor.

Using GUI Preferences, you can set your general preferences and when you are done, just choose "Save" option.

If you are defining preferences using JSON you must follow the Default General Preferences syntax which you can see at the bottom of this section.

For example, if you wish to change a Theme, you'll see it is set to:

```json
"workspace": { 
    "theme": "monokai" 
} 
```

And now you can change it inside Preferences -> User/Project -> General, by adding code:

```json
"workspace": { 
    "theme": "white" 
}
```

And by doing this, you'll override settings from Default.

All Default General Preferences:

}
```


## Key Bindings

Nearly every action in Codeanywhere has a corresponding command associated with it. On top of that, every command also has a key binding that can be used to effortlessly execute the command.

Key Bindings preferences can be defined for two categories: PC and Mac.

Using GUI Preferences, you can change existing commands and when you are done, just choose "Save" option.

![](/images/keybindings.png)

If you are defining preferences using JSON you must follow the Default Key Bindings Preferences syntax which you can see at the bottom of this section.

For example, if you wish to change key shortcut for auto indenting, you'll see it is set to:

```json
"auto_indent": {
    "keys": ["Alt-Shift-Tab"]
}
```

And now you can change it inside Preferences -> User/Project -> Key Bindings, by adding code:

```json
"auto_indent": {
    "keys": ["Alt-Shift-Tab-A"]
}
```

And by doing this, you'll override settings from Default.

## FileTypes
For syntax highlighting and language support, Codeanywhere uses [Codemirror](https://codemirror.net). CodeMirror supports over two dozen different modules, and any changes made to CodeMirror are reflected back into Codeanywhere. By default, files are highlighted based on their file extension. You can still add new extensions in User or Project preferences and override the ones from General preferences

Using GUI Preferences, you can change existing filetype exentions or add a new one using option menu and when you are done, just choose "Save" option.

![](/images/filetypes.png)

If you are defining preferences using JSON you must follow the Default FileTypes Preferences syntax which you can see at the bottom of this section.

For example, if you wish to add new extension for HTML mode, you'll see it is set to:

```js
"HTML": { 
  "extension": ["html", "htm"]
}
```
And now you can add CTP extension inside Preferences -> User/Project -> File Types, by adding code:

```js
"HTML": { 
  "extension": ["html", "htm", "CTP"]
}
```

And by doing this, you'll override settings from Default.

## Linting
For JavaScript files, Codeanywhere provides analysis using a combination of our own analysis tools, as well as JSHint (specifically for Javascript code). Our language analysis can't detect if your program is correct, fast, nor has memory leaks, but it can save you time by spotting things like undeclared variables, syntax errors, or other preventable typos. When Codeanywhere detects an issue with your code, an icon appears in the gutter (located left from the editor) for the offending lines of code.

If you hover over any of these icons in the gutter, you'll get a pop-up that presents some information as to what, exactly, the problem is.

There are a lot of parameters in which criteria linting should be done. You can change this parameters using Linting Preferences.

Using GUI Preferences, you can set your linting preferences and when you are done, just choose "Save" option.

If you are defining preferences using JSON you must follow the Default Linting Preferences syntax which you can see at the bottom of this section.

## Snippets

Snippets are smart templates that will insert text for you and adapt it to their context. They allow you to generate commonly used code syntax from a shortcut as soon as possible. This way, you can quickly re-use any code!

### Using snippets
Snippets are essentially an "autocomplete feature" and are used in similar fashion. For example, in JavaScript mode there is a snippet which helps scaffolding a "for loop" and it is defined using a "for" prefix.

This means, any time you start writing the word "for" you will get a "snippet autocomplete suggestion":

![](/images/snippet-for-suggestion.png)

if you hit "enter" on that suggestion, a "for loop" will appear:

![](/images/snippet-for-loop.png)

as you can see, besides entering a part of code, a snippet had also defined multiple cursors for you, so in this case "index" can easily be changed to "i":

![](/images/snippet-for-loop-i.png)

when you are done changing "index" keyword, just hit "tab" key, and this will select next part of the code that you probably need to change, like in this case "array" variable:

![](/images/snippet-for-loop-array.png)

### Creating Snippets

Using GUI Preferences, you can remove existing snippets or add a new one using option menu and when you are done, just choose "Save" option.

![](/images/snippets.png)

You can define your snippets for specific languages in User or Project Preferences in a JSON format as well.

Here is an example for "For Loop" snippet for JavaScript:

```js
"For Loop": {
	"prefix": "for",
	"body": [
		"for (var ${1:index} = 0; ${1:index} < ${2:array}.length; ${1:index}++) {",
		"\tvar ${3:element} = ${2:array}[${1:index}];",
		"\t$4",
		"}"
	],
	"scope": {
		"mode": ["JavaScript"]
	},
	"description": "For Loop snippet"
},
```

In the example above:

* _For Loop_ is the snippet name
* _prefix_ defines a prefix used for listing a Snippet. In this example, just enter the Tab key after typing "for" and you'll see your Snippet content.
* _body_ is the Snippet content.
* _scope_ containes mode of your Snippet. In this case it is JavaScript mode.
* _description_ explains data in a Snippet.

You can use $id and ${id:label} for variables since variables with the same name are connected. Since the syntax is like this: ${id:label}, each acts as a default value for a tab stop. With the help of field markers, you can cycle through positions within the snippet by pressing the Tab key.

Identical field markers mirror each other: when you edit the first one, the rest will be populated with the same value in real time. By expanding the field syntax a little bit, you can define default values for a field. Placeholders are useful when thereâ€™s a general case for your snippet but you still want to keep its customization convenient.

In order to edit Snippet file go to Preferences -> User/Project -> Snippets

For example, in order to change For Loop defined in Default Preferences, go to Preferences -> User/Project -> Snippets and type:

```js
"For Loop": {
	"prefix": "for",
	"body": [
		"for (var ${2:index} = 0; ${2:index} < ${1:array}.length; ${2:index}++) {",
		"\tvar ${3:element} = ${1:array}[${2:index}];",
		"\t$4",
		"}"
	],
	"scope": {
		"mode": ["JavaScript"]
	},
	"description": "For Loop snippet"
},
```

This will change your For Loop for javascript to start defining array and then index.

    "prefix": "fn",

      "function() {",
