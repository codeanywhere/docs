## Bookmarks
To easily navigate in large files you can use Editor bookmarks. Bookmarks are tied to the line so if you delete or add new lines it will move the bookmark as well.

Bookmarks shortcuts:

* Toggle bookmark (Cmd-F2)
* Jump to next bookmark (F2)
* Jump to previous bookmark (Shift-F2)
* Clear bookmarks (Shift-Cmd-F2)

All shortcuts can be changed using [Key Binding Preferences](#key-bindings)
