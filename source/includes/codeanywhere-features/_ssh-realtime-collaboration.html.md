## SSH Realtime Collaboration
You shared your project and you want to give that user SSH access so you can collaborate from there? No problem! Select that connection and press share in top menu bar afterwards.

Please keep in mind that your SSH should be open. Your collaborator will receive a notification in top right corner that says: "user@mail.com has requested SSH terminal session collaboration on connection name_of_connection with you".
