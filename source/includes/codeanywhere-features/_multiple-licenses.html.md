## Multiple Licenses

If you’re managing a huge number of employees, or if you are just a small team, Codeanywhere’s feature Multiple License, enables you to manage your entire team accounts, including which plans, add-ons and permissions they have.

Once you have set up and upgraded your primary Codeanywhere account to a Premium Plan, you can easily add additional accounts over which you have complete control. Management of this feature is done through your [Dashboard](#dashboard) by purchasing an Addon and it consists of creating new, or adding existing accounts under your management, granting of add-ons and, if necessary, closing the accounts.
