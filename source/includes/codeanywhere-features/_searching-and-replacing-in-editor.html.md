## Searching and Replacing in Editor
### Quicksearch
Quicksearch can be activated by hitting Cmd-F on a Mac, or Ctrl-F on a Unix/Windows machine. As you type in the quicksearch bar, the code with the matching text is underlined, and if you want to move between the matching results you can use the arrow keys on the right side which will instantly shift you to the next available result. This is a great way to quickly search around in your code without hassle.

Quicksearch offers the following options: ● Regular Expressions: when enabled, your search is treated as a regular expression ● Match Case: when enabled, your search is case sensitive

### Search and Replace
Building on the features of quicksearch, search and replace allows you to replace segments of code in your file. Replacing offers two options like quicksearch: ● Match Case: when enabled, your search is case sensitive ● Regular Expressions: when enabled, your search is treated as a regular expression

If you don't want to use keyboard shortcuts, the find feature is also located on top of File Explorer and is represented by magnifying glass icon and the "Find" text.
