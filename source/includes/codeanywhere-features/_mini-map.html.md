## Mini Map
A MiniMap is like a wider scroll bar in which you see a mini version of the entire file you’re working on. It is a very user productive feature as it allows you to scroll through your file with speed and ease by using the compressed image of your text on the upper right hand corner. MiniMap will be enabled to all our users by default. In case you don’t want to use MiniMap, you can disable it by doing the following: View -> MiniMap

![](/images/minimap.png)

and making sure MiniMap option isn’t checked. Of course, you can re-enable it at any time by the same method
