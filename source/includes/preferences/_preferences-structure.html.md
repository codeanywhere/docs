## Preferences Structure
Youâ€™ll see preferences in Top Menu Bar. Preferences can be defined in one of two Layers: User and Project Preferences. When retrieving a preference value, preferences defined in Project layer are taken first, then if not defined there, values from User Lazer are used and if nothing is defined there as well, Default value is used.

Preferences can be defined using Graphical user interface or by editing JSON file.

Bz default, GUI Preferences is used but if you prefer defining your preferences in JSON, you can turn on "Open as JSON" in Preferences section of Top Menu Bar.

There is 5 Preferences categories:

* [General](#general)
* [Key Bindings](#key-bindings)
* [FileTypes](#filetypes)
* [Linting](#linting)
* [Snippets](#snippets)
