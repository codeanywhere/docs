## Snippets

Snippets are smart templates that will insert text for you and adapt it to their context. They allow you to generate commonly used code syntax from a shortcut as soon as possible. This way, you can quickly re-use any code!

### Using snippets
Snippets are essentially an "autocomplete feature" and are used in similar fashion. For example, in JavaScript mode there is a snippet which helps scaffolding a "for loop" and it is defined using a "for" prefix.

This means, any time you start writing the word "for" you will get a "snippet autocomplete suggestion":

![](/images/snippet-for-suggestion.png)

if you hit "enter" on that suggestion, a "for loop" will appear:

![](/images/snippet-for-loop.png)

as you can see, besides entering a part of code, a snippet had also defined multiple cursors for you, so in this case "index" can easily be changed to "i":

![](/images/snippet-for-loop-i.png)

when you are done changing "index" keyword, just hit "tab" key, and this will select next part of the code that you probably need to change, like in this case "array" variable:

![](/images/snippet-for-loop-array.png)

### Creating Snippets

Using GUI Preferences, you can remove existing snippets or add a new one using option menu and when you are done, just choose "Save" option.

You can define your snippets for specific languages in User or Project Preferences in a JSON format as well.

Here is an example for "For Loop" snippet for JavaScript:

```js
"For Loop": {
	"prefix": "for",
	"body": [
		"for (var ${1:index} = 0; ${1:index} < ${2:array}.length; ${1:index}++) {",
		"\tvar ${3:element} = ${2:array}[${1:index}];",
		"\t$4",
		"}"
	],
	"scope": {
		"mode": ["JavaScript"]
	},
	"description": "For Loop snippet"
},
```

In the example above:

* _For Loop_ is the snippet name
* _prefix_ defines a prefix used for listing a Snippet. In this example, just enter the Tab key after typing "for" and you'll see your Snippet content.
* _body_ is the Snippet content.
* _scope_ containes mode of your Snippet. In this case it is JavaScript mode.
* _description_ explains data in a Snippet.

You can use $id and ${id:label} for variables since variables with the same name are connected. Since the syntax is like this: ${id:label}, each acts as a default value for a tab stop. With the help of field markers, you can cycle through positions within the snippet by pressing the Tab key.

Identical field markers mirror each other: when you edit the first one, the rest will be populated with the same value in real time. By expanding the field syntax a little bit, you can define default values for a field. Placeholders are useful when thereâ€™s a general case for your snippet but you still want to keep its customization convenient.

In order to edit Snippet file go to Preferences -> User/Project -> Snippets

For example, in order to change For Loop defined in Default Preferences, go to Preferences -> User/Project -> Snippets and type:

```js
"For Loop": {
	"prefix": "for",
	"body": [
		"for (var ${2:index} = 0; ${2:index} < ${1:array}.length; ${2:index}++) {",
		"\tvar ${3:element} = ${1:array}[${2:index}];",
		"\t$4",
		"}"
	],
	"scope": {
		"mode": ["JavaScript"]
	},
	"description": "For Loop snippet"
},
```

This will change your For Loop for javascript to start defining array and then index.
